## Introduction
Ah, yes. The iconic Rock Paper Scissors game. I wrote this simple program that allows you to play the game by yourself, against the computer. There's no strategy logic involved - it literally just picks a random action between rock, paper and scissors. It's incredibly simple and should work on every platform you try it on. *Should.* This actually helped me learn quite a bit about Python, including `elif` statements, something I had never actually used before. It's incredible how much you learn just by writing something simple like this.

Yes, I know it's a bit of a stupid program, but I wrote it to learn. Not like it's original or anything - this is probably one of the first things coders make besides the iconic 'Hello World' program - besides maybe a higher or lower game. And trust me; there will be lots more 'stupid' programs posted here as I make my way through the world of Python and computer programming.

## How do I run this?
If you're a complete beginner like me, you're probably wondering how to run this program. It's quite simple:
* Go to the [official Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads) and download the latest version for you. As of March 11, 2024, that is Python 3.12.2. If you're a Linux user, you can also find it through various package managers e.g. apt, pacman, dnf. Some Linux distributions also come with Python pre-installed - to check, run `python3` in your terminal application.
* Once you've got the latest version installed, go through the setup process. This may be different depending on what operating system you run.
* Whenever you've setup Python, go to your terminal application. For Windows and MacOS users, that will be your 'Terminal' application, or alternatively Powershell/CMD on Windows. For Linux, that can be anything from the tty to your fully riced out terminal.
* Run `python3` to check if Python has successfully installed. If not, go through the setup process again.
* Now, it's as simple as running `python3 (the path to where you installed the .py file e.g. C:\Users\(your username}\Downloads\rps.py on Windows)`.
* Viola! You're playing Rock Paper Scissors - congrats!
